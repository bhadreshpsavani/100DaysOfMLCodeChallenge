Day2 : 15th April 2019

- python lib called OS is used to make folder and file handling related operations,

- matplotlib.image is used for image related operations


Day3: 16th April 2019

Canny Edge Detection algorithm
- edges = cv2.Canny(gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)
The John Canny recommended low_threshold to high_threshold ratio to be 1:2, 1:3


Hough Transformation: 
- a line in image space corresponds to a point in Hough space, A point in image space describes a line in Hough space

- Two points in image space correspond to two lines in Hough Space. Not only that, but these lines must intersect

we have two intersecting lines in Hough Space. How would you represent their intersection at the point (m0, b0) in image space?
- The intersection point at (m0, b0) represents the line y = m0x + b0 in image space and it must be the line that passes through both points!

lines=cv2.HoughLinesP(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold, np.array([]),min_line_length,max_line_gap)
