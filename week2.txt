Day1: 21st March 2019

I learn that we can make OCR based model for single line of text using Keras and TensorFlow.

*Conectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Loss function : Applied to identified word by removing
    words and white spaces

We can make OCR based model for entire text consist of multiple line, for that we need to do some Preprossessing

DIA(Document Image Analysis): 
                            1. Image Segmentation
                            2. word Extraction
                            3. Text Recongnition using OCR 
                            4. Error reduction of words using Language model or Dictionary APIs

3. Text Recongnition using OCR :
    2 methods:
        1. LSTM
        2. Uniform Segmentation

Line Normalization using 'ocrolib':
    'https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy/blob/master/doc/line-normalization.ipynb'

*To avoid network overfitting we stopped the training process several times and 
continued training the network with the new dataset

Day2: 22 march 2019

started Watching videos related to using python for AI.

wanted to learn libraries like 1. numpy: for array manipulation
                               2. Pandas: data Manipulation and Analysis
                               3. scikit: data Visulization
                               4. python: facebook lib for deep learning
